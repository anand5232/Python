1. creation of list and changing value of any one element also display the length of list
2. create a list and append two elements in it.
3. create a list of number and print sum of all the element using function
4. program to find the maximum and minimum of list.
5. count the occurrence of element in list.
6. reverse a list
7. write a loop that traverse the previous list and print the length of each element.
8. write a progeam that take a list of number (for example a=[5,10,15,20,25] and make a new list
 of only the first and last elements of the given list. for pratice write this code inside 
a function . 

9.take two list say for example these two 
    a=[1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89]
    b=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13]
and write a program that list that only contain elements.
    
10. write a user defined function that reads a some integers between 1 to 20 and count the
   occurrences of each . Here is a sample run

   
11. compute the standard deviation and mean of number in a list
mean = _
       x = summation x1/n1

standarddeviation           _
  s= underroot summation (x-x)/(n-1)
